  <h1>About Us</h1>
</div>

<p>A sure way to help the world is by helping one person at a time. Daily, we come across multiple
cases with potential for our reaching out. Yet, we hesitate. We either find it ‘out of our capacity’ to 
financially support the entire cause or we are unsure of its authenticity.</p>

<p>Here is where Helping Hands comes in. We provide the perfect and most transparent medium of 
offering your help to the needy, where your contribution is backed up by many others’. Thus, we 
offer a platform by which multiple donors can help the less privileged in our society fearlessly and 
without reserve.</p>

<p>Further, we would like our partners to know that all administrative expenses at Helping Hands is 
taken care of exclusively by our Core team and associates.</p>

<p>Today, it is indeed difficult to trust the medium and motive of many organisations. Therefore, our 
team ensures that ‘needs’ are verified as genuine by Helping Hands, backed up with legit 
documentation as required to safeguard the donation procedure. This way, both donor and recipient 
are granted complete transparency.</p>

<p>Helping Hands is a non-profit mediator created by a team of selfless individuals who will ensure 
100% financial help moving from one or more donors to recipient. Helping Hands does not own any 
bank account, and hence your entire Contribution will reach the recipient account directly. Thus, 
there can and will be no income tax benefits. By this, we highlight our intention of purely helping 
those in need without any ulterior motive.</p>

<p>The founders at Helping Hands have been reaching out to the needy for a long time. Their initiative 
through this platform will allow you and other volunteers to partake of their humanitarian kindness.</p>
